- Hi, I’m @julianzentenos. I completed a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Master of Science in Finance (c).
- In my master's thesis project, I treated the relation between the corporate responsibility and the flow distribution of the investment funds from LATAM.
  There I found that, funds with higher corporate responsibility score increase the probability of in-flows, which implies a higher first and third moment of the funds' flows distribution.
- My principal interests are innovation, sustainability, and technology. As experience, my main works were based on academic investigations about corporate sustainability and social impacts on markets.
- I’m currently working as a research assistant with a full professor from the business school of the Universidad de Chile.
